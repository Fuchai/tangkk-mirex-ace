- run matlab script in funcs\train to get raw training data from audios (example runs are shown in runscript.m)

- go to the raw/ folder in D:\MIR\, containing the raw datas such as trainingData-JayChou29-6seg-inv.mat (or oninv, or no7)

- load the raw data into matlab, use the ``savedata.m'' script to save the data you want, modify the script for different use. (whether is 1.6seg or song; 2. ch or ns; 3. inv, noinv or no7; 4. whether use -v7.3 (for ns song and varlen)) (the saved data will be at data/ch/ or data/ns/)

- use pkldatagen.py to generate the .pkl files for -song .mat files (don't touch the 6seg .mat files)

- delete the -song .mat files

- refer to the todo.py script, open an ipython notebook to arrange model training

- run the ipython notebook to collect models (the models will be at data/model/)
