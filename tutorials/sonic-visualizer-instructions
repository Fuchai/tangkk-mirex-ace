This explains how to build up ground truths annotations using sonic-visualizer (no need to use Reaper)

1. open sonic visualizer
2. import the audio to be annotated to sonic visualizer
3. layer -> add new time instant layer (use instant layer instead of region layer to ease the editing job)
4. click enter(at the number pad) or ';' to add new instant at playback position (the right most enter), remember to add one instant at the endtime, and put a label 'N' to the last region; and add one instant at start time, label it as correspond to the chord (possibly 'N' at start time)
5. layer -> edit layer data (to edit the chords at every region)
6. file -> export annotation layer
7. fill ends of the file content using transformGT.m (and it will change the file from .txt to .lab)
