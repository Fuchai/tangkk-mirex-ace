To perform the analysis call:

out = getmeasures2(fname,ts);
ts is an optional input parameter to specify the number of beats per bar

out is a struct with the following data

out.beats - beat times in seconds
out.measures - bar boundaries in seconds
out.timesig - estimate of the number of beats per bar (will = ts if specified)
out.df - the onset detection function


The code is set to downsample the audio file to 11025Hz before processing
This speeds up the calculation of the onset detection function but has
negligible effect on the output of the beat tracker.
