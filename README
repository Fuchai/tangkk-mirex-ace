This is the README for MIREX 2015 ACE task:

Command line calling format for all executables and an example formatted set of commands:
- doChordID.sh testFileList.txt testout/ (on Linux)
- doChordID-win.sh testFileList.txt testout/ (on Windows)
- doChordID-osx.sh testFileList.txt testout/ (on Mac)
- The inputs are specified in testFileList.txt
- The analyzed results can be found in the testout/ folder

Number of threads/cores used or whether this should be specified on the command line:
- N/A

Expected memory footprint:
- Here's a reference of the memory usage of MATLAB
>> memory
Maximum possible array:       32334 MB (3.390e+10 bytes) *
Memory available for all arrays:       32334 MB (3.390e+10 bytes) *
Memory used by MATLAB:        1225 MB (1.285e+09 bytes)
Physical Memory (RAM):       32692 MB (3.428e+10 bytes)

And the task manager shows a memory usage of about average 700 MB and maximum 1 GB during execution.

Expected runtime:
- For a 3 minutes song, executed with the MATLAB shell, the running time of the program is about 25 seconds on a 64bit windows machine with 32G RAM and E5-2650 @ 2.3GHz processor (the main bottleneck is multiple calls of "lsqnonneg" to solve many nnls problems)

Any required environments (and versions), e.g. Python, Java, bash, MATLAB.
- MATLAB R2015a or later
- cygwin if run on windows
